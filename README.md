ChainOX Core v1.2.0.4
===============================

ChainOX was founded by an unknown developer in China. On April 9, 2022 that developer abandonded the project. The very next day, the unified community launched a new website and Discord. As a community ChainOX will continue and thrive moving forward. 

NOTE: The ChainOX community has no plans for establishing a bridge to DeFi as the origial developers did. The focus will remain with developing and supporting the ChainOX blockchain itself.
